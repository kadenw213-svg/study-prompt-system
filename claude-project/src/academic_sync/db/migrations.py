"""Lightweight forward-only migrations.

Alembic is overkill for a single-user local SQLite file, but "just call
create_all()" silently drifts once real data exists. Instead: each schema
change is a numbered, idempotent function appended to MIGRATIONS. On startup
we compare the stored schema_version against len(MIGRATIONS) and apply
whatever is missing, in order. Never edit an already-shipped migration function
after it has been released -- add a new one instead, the same rule as any
other migration tool.
