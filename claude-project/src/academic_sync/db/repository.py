    Returns the row. Caller is responsible for deciding CREATE vs UPDATE
    semantics upstream (reconciliation.decide_action) -- this function just
    performs the write once that decision has been made.

    **Downgrade guard** (real incident, 2026-08-19): fingerprint identity is
    deliberately independent of `date` (see reconciliation/fingerprint.py's
    module docstring -- a wording/date change should UPDATE, not duplicate).
    But that same property means a *worse* re-extraction of the same
    logical item -- one that fails to find a date this pass, for whatever
    reason (a missing `--allow-bare-dates` flag, a slightly different page
    render, a source temporarily truncated) -- matches the identical
    fingerprint and, before this guard, silently overwrote `date`/
    `due_time`/`start_time`/`end_time`/`status` back to unknown on a row
    that was already CLEAR (or SYNCED, with a real live Calendar event
    already reflecting the correct date). This happened for real to two
    MAT1340 assignments: both had genuine, already-synced Calendar events
    with the correct 11/11 and 11/15 due dates, while the local row had
    regressed to `date=None, status=UNRESOLVED` -- the live Calendar was
    silently more correct than the local database is supposed to
    represent, and nothing surfaced the drift.

    Root cause is structural, not just this one incident: `cli.py`'s
    `extract` command computes a plan (CREATE/UPDATE/CONFLICT/REVIEW) and
    prints it, but the actual write loop calls this function unconditionally
    for every extracted candidate regardless of what the plan says -- the
    plan has been informational only, never a real gate. This guard makes
    the safe behavior the default at the one place every write path (CLI
    extract, ad-hoc scripts, tests) actually funnels through, rather than
    depending on every caller to re-derive "is this actually an improvement"
    correctly every time.

    Default (`allow_downgrade=False`): if the existing row already has
    `status in (CLEAR, SYNCED)` and a confirmed `date`, and the incoming
    item's `date` is `None`, the date/time/status fields are **not**
    overwritten -- the existing (better) values are kept, and an
    `UnresolvedReferenceKind.CONFLICTING_SOURCES` reference is recorded so
    the drift is visible instead of silent. Every other field (title,
    links, points, module_label, etc.) still updates normally -- this only
    guards against *losing* a confirmed date, not against real content
    refinements. Pass `allow_downgrade=True` for a deliberate, reviewed
    correction (e.g. a source that explicitly says the date was wrong)."""
