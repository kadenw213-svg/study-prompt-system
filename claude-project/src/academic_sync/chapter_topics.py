"""Parsing/canonicalization helpers for chapter/unit topic identity.

A "chapter/unit label" (e.g. "Chapter 23", "Unit 2") is how the system
recognizes that a lecture's title, a weekly reading block's title, and a
saved `ChapterTopic` row are all talking about the same real chapter --
independent of exact wording differences between where each label was
typed. This module is the single place that regex lives; `sync/
calendar_payload.py::_topic_line` and `db/repository.py`'s chapter-topic
lookups both build on it rather than each keeping their own copy.
