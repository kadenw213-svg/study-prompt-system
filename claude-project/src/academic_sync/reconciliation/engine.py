"""Stage: reconciliation. Decides what a sync would DO, without doing it.

This module never calls Google Calendar. It compares an incoming
(freshly extracted) AcademicItem against whatever is already stored locally
under the same fingerprint, plus that item's SyncRecord, and returns a
SyncAction. The actual Calendar write happens in the academic-import skill,
which calls Claude's Google Calendar connector and then records the result
via db.repository.upsert_sync_record.

    `SyncRecord.google_event_id`) got `module_label`/`reference_url`

    pipeline. Standalone `plan` compares an item's current stored state
    against *itself* (see `sync/planner.py::compute_plan` -- both
    `existing` and `incoming` resolve to the same row when there's no
    fresh extraction to diff against), so `representation_changed` can
    never detect this class of drift no matter which fields it checks --
    there is nothing else to compare against. This snapshot is what
    closes that gap: it's a real record of what was true *at the moment
    of the last actual push*, independent of what's in the row right now.
