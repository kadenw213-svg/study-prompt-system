# 2026-08-18) that Google Calendar's fullText search does not index text
# inside an HTML comment (<!-- ... -->), so hiding the tag that way breaks
# the backstop it exists for. Two shrink/de-emphasis approaches were then
# tried: inline `style="font-size:...;color:..."` on a <span> is stripped
# by Calendar's sanitizer (rendered at normal size/color, confirmed by
# inspecting the popup) -- but wrapping in the semantic `<small>` tag
# *is* preserved (visibly smaller text in the rendered popup) and remains
# fullText-searchable (confirmed by creating a real event and searching for
# the tag content). So the tag is wrapped in `<small>` -- smaller, but not
# hidden, which is the best achievable balance between "the idempotency
# backstop still works" and "not visually shouting at the bottom of every
# event." If a future session wants to try something else here, re-verify with a
# real create_event + list_events(fullText=...) round trip first -- don't
